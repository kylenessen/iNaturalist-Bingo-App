# iNaturalist Bingo App

A Streamlit web application that generates educational bingo cards using real species observation data from iNaturalist. Create customizable PDF bingo cards featuring local wildlife species with photos, common names, and scientific names - perfect for nature education, field trips, and outdoor activities.

üåê **Live App**: <https://inaturalist-bingo.streamlit.app/>

## Features

- **Real Species Data**: Fetches research-grade species observations from iNaturalist for any geographic location
- **Flexible Grid Sizes**: Support for 3√ó3, 5√ó5, 7√ó7, and 9√ó9 bingo card layouts
- **Customizable Content**: Toggle display of photos, common names, and scientific names independently
- **Batch Generation**: Create multiple unique cards (1-100) with different species combinations
- **Seasonal Filtering**: Filter species by specific months for seasonal activities
- **Professional PDFs**: Generate print-ready PDFs with optimized layouts and high-quality images
- **No API Keys Required**: Uses public iNaturalist API with no registration needed

## How It Works

1. **Find Your Location**: 
   - Go to [iNaturalist Places](https://www.inaturalist.org/places)
   - Search for your desired location (e.g., "California")
   - Copy the place ID from the URL (e.g., `california-us` from `https://www.inaturalist.org/places/california-us`)
   - Alternatively, you can try entering a place name directly and the app will attempt to find it
2. **Configure Your Cards**: Choose grid size, number of species, and display options
3. **Generate**: Create 1-100 unique bingo cards with different species combinations
4. **Download**: Get a PDF file ready for printing and use in the field
